    "Generating Predictions: During forward propagation, the input data is processed layer by layer, with each layer transforming the input data using its weights, biases, and activation functions.

The final layer's output is typically the predicted output or the output of interest in tasks such as classification, regression, or generation.\n",

    "Information Flow: Forward propagation establishes the flow of information through the neural network. The output of each layer becomes the input for the subsequent layer. By sequentially passing the input data through the network, the neural network leverages its learnable parameters (weights and biases) and non-linear activation functions to progressively transform the input information, extract relevant features, and build hierarchical representations. This flow of information allows the network to capture complex relationships and patterns within the data.\n",

    "Activation functions are applied to the outputs of individual neurons during forward propagation in neural networks. The activation function introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn and model complex relationships in the data. Here's how activation functions are used during forward propagation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Neuron Activation: Each neuron in a neural network takes the weighted sum of its inputs (including the bias term) and applies an activation function to the result. The weighted sum is often referred to as the \"activation potential\" or \"pre-activation\" and denoted as z.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Linearity: The activation function is then applied to the activation potential (z) to introduce non-linearity to the neuron's output. The non-linearity is a crucial component that enables the network to learn complex patterns and make nonlinear predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Generation: The result of the activation function becomes the output of the neuron, which is then used as an input to subsequent neurons in the network. This output is often denoted as the neuron's activation (a).\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of Activation Functions: There are various activation functions used in neural networks, each with its characteristics and purposes. Some commonly used activation functions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sigmoid Function: The sigmoid function squashes the input into the range of (0, 1). It is commonly used in the output layer for binary classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tanh Function: The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function squashes the input into the range of (-1, 1). It is similar to the sigmoid function but symmetric around zero, making it more suitable for hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU): The ReLU function sets all negative inputs to zero and keeps positive inputs unchanged. It is widely used in hidden layers and has the advantage of being computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaky ReLU: The Leaky ReLU function is similar to ReLU but allows small negative values instead of zero. It prevents the issue of \"dying ReLU\" where neurons with negative inputs remain inactive and do not contribute to learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Softmax Function: The softmax function is typically used in the output layer for multi-class classification problems. It computes the probabilities of each class, ensuring they sum up to 1."

    "Feature Importance: The weights represent the importance or significance of each input feature in the context of the network's task. Higher weights indicate that the corresponding feature has a stronger influence on the neuron's output.\n",
    "Learnable Parameters: The weights are initially assigned random values and are updated during the training process using optimization algorithms like gradient descent or its variants. Through iterative training, the network adjusts the weights to minimize the prediction error and improve the model's performance.\n",

    "Biases:\n",

    "Shifting the Output: Biases introduce a shift or offset to the neuron's output, allowing the network to model relationships that do not necessarily pass through the origin. Biases act as adjustable intercepts, independently of the input values.\n",
    "Flexibility in Modeling: By adjusting the biases, neural networks can control the output even when the weighted sum is zero or close to zero. Biases provide flexibility in modeling by enabling the network to learn different thresholds or decision boundaries.\n",
    "Bias-Weight Interaction: Biases interact with weights during forward propagation. The bias term is multiplied by a fixed input of 1, and its weight is adjusted along with the other weights during training. This interaction allows the network to learn appropriate offsets or biases for different features."
